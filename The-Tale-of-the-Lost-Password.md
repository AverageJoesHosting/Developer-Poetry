Oh gather round and hear my song,
Of a password lost so long.
Forgotten by the weary dev,
Who sought the vault where secrets slept.

The keys were hashed, the salts were strong,
But memory played a cruel song.
“Was it ‘password123’?” they cried,
“Or some random phrase that I contrived?”

The system mocked their futile tries,
Captcha dancing before their eyes.
And so they clicked "Forgot my key,"
A reset link, their destiny.
