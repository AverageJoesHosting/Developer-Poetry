Oh, Stack Overflow, my guiding light,
Through endless errors, you make things right.
A sea of answers, both kind and bold,
Where wisdom thrives and tales are told.

But woe to thee who does not search,
Duplicate threads leave you in the lurch.
So upvote the hero, and give thanks anew,
For the ones who debug more than you.
