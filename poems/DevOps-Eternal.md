The pipeline spins, the logs run deep,
A cycle unbroken, day and night.
The system’s uptime, what we keep,
Through countless sprints, we make it right.

A cycle unbroken, day and night,
The deploys whisper, "Please don’t fail."
Through countless sprints, we make it right,
Our servers sail in the digital gale.

The deploys whisper, "Please don’t fail,"
As metrics tick and pagers chime.
Our servers sail in the digital gale,
A life in code, beyond all time.
