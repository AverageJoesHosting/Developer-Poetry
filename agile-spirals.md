Sprint to the goal, they said,
Yet the finish line keeps moving.
Stand-ups, backlog grooming, retrospectives—
A cadence of chaos we pretend to control.

Stories broken down to points,
Tasks carved into kanban lanes,
Yet the unknown always lurks—
A bug, an outage, a feature reimagined.

We spiral toward the next release,
Agile in name, human at heart.
