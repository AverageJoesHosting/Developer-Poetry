The loop repeats, the logic flows,
An infinite dance within the code,
It runs until the server slows.

A missing break, no end to woes,
A flaw unseen, the bug is showed,
The loop repeats, the logic flows.

The logs grow long, the error grows,
The system halts, the userâ€™s owed,
It runs until the server slows.

At last, a fix, the code bestows,
A lesson learned, the truth bestowed:
The loop repeats, the logic flows,
It runs until the server slows.
