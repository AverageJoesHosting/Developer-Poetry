"Ship it now!" the manager screams,
But I’ve seen what happens to broken dreams.
A staging pass, some QA tests,
The pipeline groans, it needs a rest.

Yet haste prevails, the button’s pressed,
Production trembles, not its best.
The logs explode, the users cry,
Another lesson: don't deploy on Friday.
