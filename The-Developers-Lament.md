Upon the screen, my weary eyes do fall,
A labyrinth of code I must traverse.
Through nested loops and queries, I do crawl,
To find the root of logic most perverse.

The hours pass, the coffee runs its course,
Yet still, the function mocks my every thought.
A silent foe, it bends with unseen force,
A battle hard, and clarity is sought.

But when the test does pass, oh sweet delight,
A conqueror am I, with joy supreme.
Though sleepless, I bask in the soft code light,
A developer’s truth, a coder’s dream.
